#todo
1. Investigate using airflow
a. Use windows wsl to run airflow, create Venv and download all dependencies.
b. Create Airflow orchestration

2. Fix Code Bugs

3. Add code that precalculates cost of running API query and fails pipeline if cost is over a certain threshold. (Airflow Parameterisation)

4. Add unit test code that will run as a first step (on/off flag).

5.

6. Create PowerBI Sample Report
Join 2 Dims to the App Tables

7. Test, Debug, Write Documentation
8. Look at refactoring script to use a class instead of functions, stardards

9. Containerise?

Some considerations here, currently an all or nothing approach - this is fine but all countries must be loaded or non at all.

Dynamically Create Env File

import os

PROJECT_ROOT_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))

with open(".env", "w") as env_file:
    env_file.write(f"PROJECT_ROOT_PATH={PROJECT_ROOT_PATH}")
